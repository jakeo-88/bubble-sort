This code will implement a method called, "bubble_sort"

The method will sort an array into an ascending order. Each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right. Once a pass through each element is done, the process will start again from the left. This continues until the array is eventually sorted.
